## Git vs. Github

Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.

There are many git hosting providers, such as github

## Vscode
To make a folder and open the vscode from terminal, follow these steps:

```mkdir tmp-git-practice```

```cd tmp-git-practice```

``` code .```

### In Vscode, install the extension 'remote-wsl' if you use wsl

## Extensions

There are literally thousands of extensions in the VS Code marketplace with new ones coming seemingly every single day!

Extensions are really important to customizing your software to suit your personal needs. So please use them!

For Git we will use the following extensions:

- Git Graph: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph

- Git Lens: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens

We highly recommend you to install the following extensions as well for a better theme (this is a personal preference and completely optional):

- Material Theme Icons

- Material Theme

- Material Icon Theme

- Dark + Material


Note: The path to git config file for each level of configuration may be slightly different on your system. To check the path to the config file for global level for example, run git config --global --edit and check the opened file path. The same applies for the other levels.
